1.So if you are building opensourse and you made a commit and then another commit where you exposed your .env for example, you can actually commit again to hide it, but if someone who has access to your application can also have access to the previous version of your application. The best way if that happened is to just change you private keys ,if possible, as removing git history is kinda big mess.

------- HTML -------
1.Phishing

------- DJANGO -------
1.Secret-Key Cryptography -> I take my priv key + my text => cyphertext <- it can only be read if I use my priv key to decrypt it.
